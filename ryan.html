            <p>This past week marked our team’s initial project milestone, focused on ideation and proposal. We successfully brainstormed a concrete game concept. We wanted to keep the game within a defined scope for this semester, while leaving the ability to scale upwards. The team collaboratively generated a wide range of ideas, ultimately deciding on a co-op puzzle-platformer with a unique twist: real-time level manipulation. We decided on the puzzle genre because once we have the mechanics and systems down, we can simply add as many levels as we like. We completed a project proposal document and a slide deck for our initial pitch presentation. We also came up with our team name: Orange Goose (Last semester, some of our team members made a board game for IAT 312 called Juiced, and some of our team members worked on an animation for IAT 343 involving cartoon geese. With these names combined, we came up with the name Orange Goose, which sounds like Orange Juice).

            >
            <p>My primary responsibility was the following sections of our project proposal:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 text-zinc-200">
              <li>
                <span class="font-medium text-zinc-100">Design Justification:</span>
                I conducted a brief analysis of relevant games, identifying <em>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</em> as a core inspiration for its asymmetric co-op roles, where players have entirely different interfaces and controls. I connected this to the level-creation freedom of games like <em>Mario Maker</em>. I then combined these into our unique premise: one player (The Maker) manipulates the level in real-time, while the other player (The Mover) navigates the resulting platforming challenges. I detailed how this creates a new layer of social interaction and problem-solving distinct from standard co-op platformers.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="font-medium text-zinc-100">Risk Mitigation &amp; Alternative Designs:</span>
                I identified and documented potential design risks. I noted the “single-player cheat,” where a skilled player might attempt to control both roles, undermining the co-op intent. To address this, I outlined alternative design choices for us to prototype, such as different control schemes and camera angles.
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="font-medium text-zinc-100">Summary:</span>
                To ensure our complex idea was easily understood, I concluded my section with a high-level summary. This included bullet points on key concepts (asymmetric co-op, real-time editing), the core game loop (Maker builds/modifies → Mover attempts platforming → both communicate to solve → progress), and a list of core mechanics for each role, as well as the narrative: The Maker is trying to help the Mover escape the confines of their computer and jump out into the real world.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Our feedback revealed the asymmetric concept has a possible problem: equal fun. While the roles are different by design, we had not yet planned how to ensure neither player feels like a passive assistant or an overworked manager over a long play session. Balancing will be necessary so that both roles feel equally enjoyable.</p>
            <p>The team can discuss implementing a role-switching mechanic at regular intervals (e.g., every 2-3 puzzles or upon player death). This ensures both players directly experience each role, promoting empathy and better teamwork.</p>
