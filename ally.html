            <p>In this milestone, our team moved from an initial design question: “what if instead of manipulating the character, you manipulate the game world itself?” into a more defined co-op game concept. We decided that the most interesting way to realize this idea was through asymmetrical co-op, where one player focuses on movement/platforming while the other focuses on editing or influencing the environment. From there, we locked in the overall direction: the game will be a 2D platformer co-op experience with clear role differences, and the fun comes from coordinating what each player can do. We also decided to have four game worlds to structure the player’s progression and keep the experience feeling fresh over time, and each world represents a different “layer” of a computer/system. We established the general vibe and gameplay possibilities for each world.
            </p>
            <p>My main contribution for this milestone was creating the look of the game world. I wanted to figure out what the game world should look like and how it should work. This way our idea becomes something that we can try out and test. I made plans for what the game world should look like, and I drew sketches to show the look and feel of the levels. I worked on the direction for the four worlds by deciding what each one should look like and what should appear in it. For example, I planned a classic retro fantasy-style game world, a messy desktop world where platforms are file folders and hazards are pop-up ads, a darker “kernel” world where platforms look like strings of code, and a hardware world with electrical hazards and cooling fans that affect movement. I made sure each world includes the important things a platformer needs, like platforms, hazards, and clear objects that players can interact with.

            <p>I also designed and drew some possible player and NPC character visuals to show our character art direction in a retro pixel-art sprite style.</p>

            <p>One of the problems I identified is that we need to find a way to balance our asymmetric design so it doesn’t create an engagement imbalance which can cause one player to feel like they’re doing most of the “fun” work while the other is mostly assisting or waiting. In the next milestone, we should define specific responsibilities for both roles and design the gameplay so each player has frequent, meaningful actions. We can also explore role-switching between levels or checkpoints so both players get a chance to experience both roles. Another problem is that we need to figure out how interactable elements will be presented in the game. For the next milestone, we should make it clear which parts of the environment are interactable by clearly distinguishing editable vs. non-editable objects, so players don’t get confused. Possible solutions include using outlines for interactable objects, particles or pulsing effects when something is editable, hover states for Maker-controlled elements, and sound cues when edits succeed or fail.
