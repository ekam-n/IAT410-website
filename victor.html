            <p>Progress wise, our team has decided on the game concept of having a computer manipulator and a platformer game character work together in creative ways. As of now, our team has a general idea of how the game would work but specifics and details will be reviewed next week due to time constraints of our current required deliveries. At the very least, we have completed our project proposal and received critiques that do not require major revisions to the original game idea. Though production wise with respect to other teams, we seem to be a little behind when it comes to how much current thought the games we are working on have.</p>
            <p>For contributions, the tasks I worked on are the content of the Title page, Timeline and Prototyping of the game proposal and the notes during the presentation. I digitally drew the rough image encapsulating the theme of our game, though realistically we won’t be using stick figures in our final delivery. I also took on the role of note taker during the presentation, not only recording critiques of our game but details and critiques of the other groups so our team can gather some inspiration and grasp where we are in terms of quality. As the one in charge of QA, I will make the effort to keep track of not only our game but the others as well to ensure our quality does not degrade when displayed with the other groups.

            <p>One thing I identified during this milestone was that our game heavily depends on the first impressions players get when they play our game. Players who are not invested within the first few minutes of our game will not have the motivation to continue to see the rest of our game. </p>
            <p>Hence I suggest during our next meeting that we focus on the first initial screen and dynamics to keep our player engaged with our game. Another thing I identified was that although our game is simple progression wise, we also need to address the concern of having our players blindly check every interactable object in our game when they get stuck on a puzzle. My thoughts on this issue would be to incorporate the computer to make diegetic UI into the interactable object in a way that a computer user would think “Maybe I can drag this menu around” or “Maybe I should hit these boxes differently and see what happens”. The last major concern was that either the game character or the computer manipulator might not have the same workload as the other or might want to switch controls. Ideally our team would design our levels to give the same workload on average but changing difficulty based on the task. Or we could occasionally swap the roles but keep the controls, like the pc controller player controls the game (Like Arkanoid) but the game character is running around the pc environment.
