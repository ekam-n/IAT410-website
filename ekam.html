            <p>This milestone, our team made solid progress moving from concept into a playable experience. We further developed our core level design ideas by clarifying what kinds of challenges we wanted players to face, and how those challenges should evolve across a level. From there, we implemented these ideas directly in our Unity prototype, turning our early design thinking into real spaces that could be navigated, tested, and iterated on. Alongside the level work, we continued building out core mechanics and features in the prototype, including foundational systems like player respawning, which helped support faster testing and a more complete gameplay loop. Once these pieces were in place, we playtested the prototype and gathered feedback on clarity, pacing, and how the controls and mechanics felt in practice. The feedback gave us a clear direction for what to adjust next, and it reinforced the value of prototyping early since we were able to identify issues that would have been hard to predict on paper.
</p>
            <p>My main contributions during this milestone were split between design direction and implementation. On the design side, I helped our team stay focused on what we want the gameplay to look and feel like moment-to-moment, especially in terms of the core loop and cooperative structure. I suggested using “mutual dependency loops” as a guiding principle, meaning the game should repeatedly create situations where each player’s actions enable the other to progress, rather than one player leading while the other follows. This helped frame our puzzle and encounter design around true interdependence, and Eva created puzzle ideas that reflected this approach. On the development side, I further built out the Unity prototype by implementing the puzzles Eva designed and making them playable. I also added key features that supported both usability and iteration speed, such as a respawn system and UI elements that improve player feedback and make the prototype easier to understand during testing. These include a controls-explanation panel and buttons for the Maker to use for platform placement.

            <p>From our playtesting, one standout issue was that the mover’s jump currently feels “floaty,” which affects the sense of control and responsiveness. The good part is that this is straightforward to address in Unity by tuning physics and movement values, such as gravity scaling, fall speed, and jump timing. In the next iteration, we can tighten the jump arc and falling behavior to create a more grounded and satisfying movement feel, then validate the improvement with another quick round of playtesting.

            <p>This past week, our team completed the first version of the game design document and refined the game’s overall flow, including narrative progression and how each level leads players toward uncovering hidden “dev backdoors.” We clarified each player’s core loop and defined the primary gameplay mode, along with key feedback and reward ideas and the game’s resolution pattern. We also designed an initial UI, explored ways to add smart depth, outlined the core loop’s appeal across visceral, behavioral, and reflective layers, iterated on protagonist and antagonist concepts, and produced early concept art focused on the core loop and overall tone.
</p>
            <p>Over the past week, I helped shape the game’s core design by refining the core loops for both the maker and the mover, clarifying each role’s key challenges and actions across traversal, combat support, and puzzle-solving. I also defined our primary gameplay mode, including the shared-screen 2D side-scroller perspective and the asymmetric interaction model where the mover navigates through an avatar while the maker operates multipresently through a mod-style placement interface. To strengthen moment-to-moment play, I ideated specific feedback for player actions, such as the maker’s ghost platform preview, clear placement confirmation through sound and physics response, and a live platform-budget counter that reinforces limits and strategy. For the mover, I emphasized responsive movement and melee feedback through animation and sound, so moment-to-moment actions feel readable and satisfying even when the maker is managing tools and UI. I also proposed a set of rewards aligned with the loop, including competence-based mastery as difficulty ramps, meaningful choice through expanded platform and movement options over time, and narrative progression through discovering dev backdoors and learning more about the rules of the game world as players get closer to escaping.

            <p>Finally, I contributed smart depth ideas that add replayability and decision-making without changing the core resolution structure, including special no-gravity platforms for maker-specific puzzle constraints and a time-based star rating system that supports skill expression and advanced play. These additions aim to create optional layers of challenge and optimization for players who enjoy mastery, while keeping the main objective focused and easy to understand.</p>
            <p>The main outstanding challenge is that we still need to validate the core loops for both the maker and the mover through hands-on testing, especially to ensure the roles feel equally engaging and the coordination remains clear under pressure. Over the next two weeks, we will focus on building a first playable version and running playtests to confirm the gameplay feels fun, readable, and achievable within the project scope. We also still need to define the visual direction of the game world and the enemy designs. This should be handled soon so we can align level design with a consistent look and feel, but it remains a lower priority than prototyping and playtesting since the project’s success depends more on the strength of the core loop than on detailed art and enemy variety.

            <p>For the proposal milestone, our team made solid progress moving from a loose “world manipulation” idea into a clearer co-op concept with defined roles, mechanics, and a cohesive direction. We aligned on an asymmetrical co-op puzzle platformer where the Mover plays inside the world using a controller, while the Maker influences the level from “outside” using mouse and keyboard controls. We also agreed on the broader themes and narrative that tie directly into the gameplay, specifically the idea of escaping the digital world through multiple computer “layers,” which helps justify why one player has a PC-like interface while the other experiences a traditional platformer view. This milestone helped us lock in a stronger identity for the game, including the tone and the retro digital vibe that supports our pitch and player experience.</p>
            <p>My main contributions were largely about coordination and clarity. I helped organize team meetings, set up the team Discord, and took on the role of structuring and leading several brainstorming sessions so we could converge faster instead of circling around too many “cool but vague” ideas. I also created our team website so we have a consistent place to share updates and keep our work organized. In the proposal document, I focused heavily on formalizing who we are designing for and why. I wrote out the intended audience details and grounded it using Brain Hex player types and Lazzaro’s fun keys, since our game depends on both communication and problem solving, not just mechanical platforming. I also contributed to defining the game structure and the core loop, including the repeated cycle of the Maker manipulating the level while the Mover navigates, survives hazards, and pushes toward the exit.</p>

            <p>The biggest issues we identified are about focus and balance. First, we need to nail down a Minimum Viable Product version of the core loop so that we can prototype quickly and prove the concept works before we add extra systems. Second, we need to ensure both roles feel equally fun and equally needed. If one role becomes “the real game” and the other becomes a helper, we lose the point of asymmetrical co-op. Related to that, we also need to think about the single player cheat risk, where one skilled player tries to control both roles, and we should test layouts like split screen versus shared screen to see what naturally encourages cooperation.</p>
